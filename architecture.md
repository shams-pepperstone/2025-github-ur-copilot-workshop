# Pomodoro Timer Web App Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for a simple Pomodoro timer web app based on the requirements and UI mockup.

## 1. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- **UI Components:**  
    - Header (Pomodoro Timer Title, Subtitle)  
    - Session indicator (Work Session/Break, Session count)  
    - Central timer display (time, status)  
    - Control buttons (Start, Reset, Skip, Settings)  

- **Timer Functionality:**  
    - Implement countdown logic (25:00 → 0:00) in JavaScript.  
    - Allow switching session states (Work/Short Break/Long Break).  
    - Show and update session number and control button states.  
    - Trigger UI prompts or transitions based on session changes.  
    - Settings should be local, unless persistence is required.  

- **Session Logging (Frontend-Backend Communication):**  
    - On session complete/skip events, POST results to Flask backend via fetch/AJAX.  

## 2. Backend (Flask, Python)

- **Serve HTML and Static Assets:**  
    - Flask serves a single-page HTML app with links to CSS/JS.  
    - Static files stored in `/static/` (CSS, JS, images).  

- **Log Session Events:**  
    - Flask receives AJAX calls on session completion/skip.  
    - Stores timestamped records in a log file (e.g., `pomodoro_log.txt`).  
    - Optional: Provide an endpoint to read session history for stats/reporting.  

- **Simple Routing:**  
    - `/` : main page  
    - `/log` : POST endpoint receiving session results  

## 3. Project Directory Structure

```
pomodoro_app/
│
├── static/
│   ├── style.css
│   └── timer.js
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── app.py               # Flask server
├── pomodoro_log.txt     # Session/event log file
└── README.md
```

## 4. Flow Example

1. **User loads page:** Flask serves `index.html`, referencing CSS/JS.  
2. **Timer runs client-side:** All timing, session logic, and UI transitions handled by JavaScript.  
3. **Session ends/skipped:** JavaScript sends a fetch POST to Flask `/log` endpoint with session info.  
4. **Flask logs event:** Appends to `pomodoro_log.txt`.  
5. *(Optional):* User can view stats/history by requesting `/history` (extendable feature).  

## 5. Notes

- **Frontend first:** Focus on UI and timer interactions.  
- **Backend next:** Handle session log logic simply.  
- **No need for user auth:** Simple personal logging app.  
- **Easily extensible:** Future features like user preferences, graphical stats, etc.

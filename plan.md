# Plan: Pomodoro Timer Web App Development

A comprehensive step-by-step development plan to build a Flask-based Pomodoro timer web app with HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, following test-driven development principles and modular implementation.

## Steps

Set up development environment - Create virtual environment using uv venv, install Flask dependencies, and establish project directory structure per architecture.md

Build Flask backend foundation - Implement basic app.py with route structure, static file serving, and placeholder endpoints for timer page and session logging

Create frontend structure - Build HTML template in templates/index.html with timer display, control buttons, and session indicators as specified in architecture.md

Implement core timer logic - Develop JavaScript countdown functionality in static/timer.js with 25-minute work sessions, break periods, and session state management

Add user interface interactions - Connect control buttons (Start, Reset, Skip, Settings) to timer logic and implement real-time UI updates for countdown display

Integrate backend logging - Implement /log POST endpoint in Flask and AJAX communication from frontend to record session completions and skips to pomodoro_log.txt

## Further Considerations

Testing granularity - Should we implement unit tests for timer functions, session state transitions, and backend endpoints separately? Or focus on integration testing for the complete timer cycles?

UI implementation approach - Start with basic functional UI matching the mockup requirements, or implement responsive design and advanced styling from the beginning?

Session logging detail level - Log only completion/skip events as specified, or include additional data like pause times, actual session duration, and user interaction patterns for future analytics?
